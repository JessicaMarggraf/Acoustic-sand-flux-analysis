This acoustic sand flux analysis aims to analyze horizontal acoustic and suspended sediment data 
to obtain continuous time series of suspended sand and fine sediment concentration. The method is
mostly based on the dual-frequency approach described by Topping and Wright (2016), but includes 
also some adjustments and improvements. Precise descriptions of the applied methods and a workflow
can be found in Marggraf (2024a) and Marggraf (2024b).

Required data
1) ASCII-converted output files of Horizontal Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (HADCPs).
2) Suspended sand (and fine sediment) measurements in the cross-section close to the HADCPs.
3) Continuous discharge, stage and total suspended sediment concentration measurements.
